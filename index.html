    <p>Sematic is the meaning of words and phrases in language. It describes meaning to both the browser and developer. Main semantic tags for larger document outlines are header, nav, aside, section, article, and footer.

            <i> Examples of semantic elements: "form", "table", and "article" - Clearly defines its content.
                  <br>Examples of non-semantic elements: "div"and "span" - Tells nothing about its content.</i></strong></p>
                </details>
    <summary>Elements such as center, font, big, and attributes such as align on imgand background on body have been depreciated - for a good reason! <br>If we maintain the philosophy that HTML is all about organization of content, and CSS as purely styling, then elements that were purely presentational donâ€™t belong within HTML.
